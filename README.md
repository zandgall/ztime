# ztime Application
Allows me to keep track of my day-to-day life, measuring and visualizing the amount of time I spend on different activities.

## ztime-cpp  
The C++ program is a graphical user interface to visualize the recorded time. Allowing you to zoom in and out, legibly reading and exploring all the data
------
Soon I expect to integrate the ability to modify the time entries in the GUI program. Along with adding different ways to filter and view the data, including measuring tools.
